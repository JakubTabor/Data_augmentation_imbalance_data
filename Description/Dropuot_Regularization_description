**DROPOUT REGULARIZATION**
# This dataset is made on (sonar data), it is full numerical data, so there is no need to preprocess it, only simple processing
* I only need to check if there is any null values and class imbalance
* Then i separate last column, it will be my (y) target feature
* And i convert my (y) into dummy column, because it is not numerical

# Now i split my data into train and test sets and check their shape and i can see class imbalance
