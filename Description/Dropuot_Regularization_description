**DROPOUT REGULARIZATION**
# This dataset is made on (sonar data), it is full numerical data, so there is no need to preprocess it, only simple processing
* I only need to check if there is any null values and class imbalance
* Then i separate last column, it will be my (y) target feature
* And i convert my (y) into dummy column, because it is not numerical

# Now i split my data into train and test sets and check their shape and i can see class imbalance
* In this case i can ignore it and show only (dropping of neurons method) for improvement in accuracy

# So i import tensorflow and keras to create my (neural net)
* I create first layer with (60 neurons) and (60 dimensions) with activation as relu
* Next i create another two (hidden layers) with (30 and 15 neurons) and same activation (relu)  
* And final (output layer with only 1 neuron) and activation as (sigmoid)

# Then i compile my model with loss as (binary_crossentropy), because of binary output
* The best optimizer in this case (adam) and i want metrics as (accuracy)

# Then I train my model with my (train sets), then (100 passes) and (8 samples)
