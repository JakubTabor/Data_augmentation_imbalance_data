# Customer_Churn_description
* In this project i gonna examine **Customer churn dataset**
* Then create a proper model and finally try to **resolve the problem of class imbalance**
* And search for **the best sampling method**

# First i make simple data preprocessing
* I take care of **TotalCharges column**, i change the type **from object** to **float64 with double precision**

# Now i plot customer churn in relation to tenure of customers
* Conclusion is that if customers have more tenure they are more likely to stay

# Next when i have idea when the customers are more willing to go and stay
* I gonna deal with all of my columns that are object columns
* So i create function that show the type of my columns
* At this stage i have a lot of object columns

* I take care of them by replacing complex informations (No internet service) to simple answer (No)
* And now i can convert (yes and no) columns into (binary form) 1 and 0

* I also replace (Female and Male) into (1 and 0)
* Then i  apply dummy variables to more complex columns
