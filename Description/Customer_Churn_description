# Customer_Churn_description
* In this project i gonna examine **Customer churn dataset**
* Then create a proper model and finally try to **resolve the problem of class imbalance**
* And search for **the best sampling method**

# First i make simple data preprocessing
* I take care of **TotalCharges column**, i change the type **from object** to **float64 with double precision**

# Now i plot customer churn in relation to tenure of customers
* Conclusion is that if customers have more tenure they are more likely to stay
