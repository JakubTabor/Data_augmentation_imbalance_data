# Customer_Churn_description
* In this project i gonna examine **Customer churn dataset**
* Then create a proper model and finally try to **resolve the problem of class imbalance**
* And search for **the best sampling method**

# First i make simple data preprocessing
* I take care of **TotalCharges column**, i change the type **from object** to **float64 with double precision**

# Now i plot customer churn in relation to tenure of customers
* Conclusion is that if customers have more tenure they are more likely to stay

# Next when i have idea when the customers are more willing to go and stay
* I gonna deal with all of my columns that are object columns
* So i create function that show the type of my columns
* At this stage i have a lot of object columns
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Data_augmentation_imbalance_data/blob/main/Images/unique_values.png)

* I take care of them by replacing complex informations (No internet service) to simple answer (No)
* And now i can convert (yes and no) columns into (binary form) 1 and 0

* I also replace (Female and Male) into (1 and 0)
* Then i  apply dummy variables to more complex columns
* Now my dataset is expanded into new columns, but it keep the complexity of the data
* There is no losse of informations 
* And choose number of epochs, same in every case

# Now my data types are changed from almost fully object types

# To fully numerical (float and int)
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Data_augmentation_imbalance_data/blob/main/Images/data_types_numerical.png)

# Now i gonna scale my columns into range (0 - 1), it will help my model in training process

# Next i prepare the data for my model
* Then i create (train and test sets) and show the class imbalance
* And show how it affect the (f1 score), which is an important measurement

# Next i create function that will be a (Neural Net model) with simple 3 (Dense layers)
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Data_augmentation_imbalance_data/blob/main/Images/ANN_model_function.png)
* Then i compile my model with (adam optimizer)
* And i set the loss during training process
* Also i include evaluation in this function 
* The prediction and (classification report)
* This function will help me automatized all training and evaluation process

# I get my first model evaluation and (the accuracy is 0.7846) which is fine, but we can boost it
* The loss is low, it is (0.4490) which is also fine
* But we can see very high class disproportion (true and predicted are 0.86 and 0.54)
* This is bad sign, we are gonna try to reduce disproportion in both classes
