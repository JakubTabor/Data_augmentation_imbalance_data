# In this section i gonna preprocess the dataset using mainly simple python and math
* I start from simpified my data into few columns: **(location, size,	total_sqft,	bath,	price)**
* I check if there are any non-values and drop them

* Then i create separate column for **(bhk- bedroom, hall and kitchen)** using lambda function
* I can see that in this dataset i have outliers with bhk greater that 20
* Its good to notice, i will deal with it later
# I see that column (total_sqft) have values with two composites
* So i create a function to search for this values
* And then create function **(convert_sqft_to_num)** 
* Which search for values with length of two tokens and take intermediate value

* Next i create **(price_per_sqft column)** which is the price column multiply by 100 000
