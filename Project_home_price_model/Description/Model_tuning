# In this section i gonna first call Linear model and then tune its parameters to achieve the best accuracy
* I start from creating X and y variables and put them into (train_test_split) and get train and test sets
* My dataset is ready for training, so i put it into Linear regression model
* And reach high accuracy, but we can achieve better score
# First i gonna try to shuffle the data and put it into 5 subsets, with it i gonna train my model

* I reach four scores that are fairly better than in previous evaluation
* And now if i want i can use **the highest, which is (0.860)**
