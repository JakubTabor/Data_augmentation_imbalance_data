# In this section i gonna first call Linear model and then tune its parameters to achieve the best accuracy
* I start from creating X and y variables and put them into (train_test_split) and get train and test sets
* My dataset is ready for training, so i put it into Linear regression model
* And reach high accuracy, but we can achieve better score
# First i gonna try to shuffle the data and put it into 5 subsets, with it i gonna train my model

* I reach four scores that are fairly better than in previous evaluation
* And now if i want i can use **the highest, which is (0.860)**

# Next i use GridSearchCV to train some models with different parameters it will be hyperparameter tuning
* I start from putting Linear Regression model and two ways for coefficients to be negative or positive (False, True) 
* Next will be lasso, i set alpha parameter to 1 and 2, it  is strength of regularization
* Also i put **selection parameter and set for random and cyclic**
* **cyclic loop over features sequentially** and **random do updated of random coefficient every iteration**
* And next is **decision_tree Regressor and parameters are:**
* First **criterion which is measurement parameter set to squared_error, so mean squared error**
* And **friedman_mse which is mean squared error with Friedman's improvement**
* And also **splitter parameter, which set the split at each node** i set them to **best and random for type of split**
