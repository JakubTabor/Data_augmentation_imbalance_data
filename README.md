 **Data_augmentation_imbalance_data**
# In this section i gonna show three examples how we can improve accuracy by implementation of some techniques
* I start with the simplest example, it will be (dropping neurons tehnic)
* I need to do only simple preparation of data for my model, because it is fully numerical
* I show the most popular activation function for (Neural net), which is relu and also sigmoid which i use in output layer

* And then i build simple sequential model
